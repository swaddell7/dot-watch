# DotWatch

* Being stuck trying to decide what to watch is just annoying. Often times you spend more time looking for a movie or show than actually watching one!

* DotWatch makes it easy to find a good movie or show based on community ratings and reviews.

* DotWatch was a group project during Mod 2 of Flatiron School! The other members of the group are linked at the bottom of this ReadMe.

# Features I Worked On

* Implementing a like feature that allows a user to like another user's review.

* Design of the content cards for films and shows, as well as user cards.

* Conditional rendering of the option to edit or delete a review that you have written, without being able to edit or delete other users' content.
DotWatch

* Filter functionality of the films and shows based on their genres. 

# Technologies

* Built with Ruby on Rails for the front-end as well as the back-end.

* Semantic UI was used to help with styling.

* Utilized sessions to help with user experience.
